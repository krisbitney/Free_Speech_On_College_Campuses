# Free_Speech_On_College_Campuses
Independent unsupervised learning project. The goals are (1) to see if students can be clustered by their positions on free speech, (2) to attempt to recover a latent variable representing political correctness, and (3) to assess the relationship between such clusters or latent variables and students' political affiliations.
