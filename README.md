# Free_Speech_On_College_Campuses
This is an independent unsupervised learning project. The goals are to...
1. See if students can be clustered by their positions on free speech
2. Attempt to recover a latent variable representing political correctness
3. Assess the relationship between such clusters or latent variables and students' political affiliations

### Results
I found that students cannot be segmented into distinct groups based on their free speech beliefs, as measured by the Stanton Free Speech Index constituent questions asked in the Gallup-Knight Foundation survey study on which this analysis is based. 

I discovered evidence for a combination of two latent variables we might in combination label "political correctness".Â 

The first variable measures opposition to free speech in general. It is a measure of the extent to which students favor promoting an inclusive society, "instituting speech codes" that could restrict "offensive or biased speech", removing first amendment protection of hate speech, and "disinviting [sic] speakers because some students are opposed to the invitation". This variable accounts for about 23% of the variance among the free speech index constituent responses.

The second variable measures the extent to which a student supports free speech generally but not necessarily on their college campus. Students high in this metric favor on-campus "speech codes" and restriction of the expression of political views that are "upsetting or offensive to certain groups" on their campuses.

There is a statistically significant relationship between the Stanton Free Speech Index and political ideology/party affiliation among college students that persists after accounting for factors socioeconomic status, college region, college sector, gender, religion and race. Conservative students tend to have more support for free speech than do moderate students, while liberal students tend to have stronger preference for protective speech policies than moderate students. And while Democrat students are less likely than Independent students to support free speech, Republic students support free speech to about the same degree as Independent students. Despite those differences, the distributions of free speech index scores retain substantial overlap when stratified by ideology or political party leanings.

### Data Source
Data for this project comes from a joint survey study by Gallup and the Knight Foundation. The study surveyed more than 3,000 students on college campuses.

### Procedure
I completed the following tasks the "StudentFreeSpeech.ipynb" Jupyter notebook:
1. Explored data
2. Assessed missing values
    * Converted missing values to NaN
    * Assessed missing values by dataframe column
    * Assessed missing values by dataframe row
    * Imputed missing values
3. Selected, re-encoded, and cleaned features
4. Created a data preprocessing pipeline
5. Standardized features
6. Reduced dimensionaly of feature space
    * Transformed feature space using principal components analysis (PCA)
    * Interpreted principal components using principal directions in original feature space
    * Quantitatively assessed impact of "curse of dimensionality"
7. Clustered customer data using four methods:
    * KMeans
    * Gaussian Mixture
    * Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN)
    * Hierarchichal/Agglomerative
8. Varied clustering algorithm hyperparameters and juxtaposed methods' internal performance
9. Estimated paramters of OLS regressions

Cluster model performance was evaluated using Silhouette score and Calinski-Harabaz score.
                  
### Required libraries                       
This project uses Numpy, Pandas, Pyplot, Seaborn, Sklearn, Statsmodels, and Jupyter.
